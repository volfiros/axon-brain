# Company Brain implementation map

Read the [master design](../requirement_doc.md) first. This folder divides coding into independently reviewable phases. The repository currently contains design documents; paths listed as deliverables are proposed files to create during implementation.

## Shared specifications

- [Graph schema](graph_schema.md): identities, source properties, relationship direction and delivery evidence.
- [Application contracts](contracts.md): typed requests, branch decisions, evidence and API responses.
- [Graph publication](graph_publication.md): projection ownership, durable incident batching, scoped read-set validation and generation-independent clarification.
- [Source adapters](source_adapters.md): required live Plane/Google Docs reads, provider mappings, labeled export fallback and smoke gates.
- [Task-branch association](task_branch_association.md): assignment/in-progress windows, author/commit evidence and Clef inference when explicit task references are absent.
- [Decision model evaluation](decision_models.md): Jev/Clef/Laya evaluation, alternatives and selection policy.
- [POC core logic review](../reviews/poc_core_logic_review.md): assessment under the hackathon POC scope and the concrete decisions needed for the demo.
- [Open questions and probable solutions](open_questions_and_probable_solutions.md): deferred non-core gaps, proposed solutions and conditions for revisiting them.
- [SRE event handling](../sre_event_handling.md): incident-assistant requirements and grounded interpretation of the supplied PDF.
- [SRE graph extension](sre_graph_schema.md): runtime, deployment, ownership, on-call and customer evidence.
- [SRE integration plan](sre_integration_plan.md): model-guided exploration, shared-phase changes, MCP access and sandbox demonstration.
- [FalkorDB resources and hackathon plan](falkordb_resources_and_hackathon_plan.md): verified event guidance, client/MCP/GraphRAG SDK choices, focused demo and submission evidence.
- [Original draft](original_requirement_doc.md): preserved source document; superseded by the master design.

## POC core decisions

The user approved these fixes for the hackathon POC on 2026-10-09. They are now design requirements in the owning specifications; application implementation and runtime checks remain future work. Curated manifests are sufficient POC inputs. Deferred production questions remain in [open questions and probable solutions](open_questions_and_probable_solutions.md).

| Review ID | Embedded decision | Authoritative specification / coding phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C-01 | Request-local suggestions, retained audit records, explicit later candidate projection | [Association lifecycle](task_branch_association.md#representation-and-use), [Phase 4](phase_04_decision_model_integration.md#clef-task-branch-discovery) |
| C-02 | Exact instance IDs / authorized picker; fresh scoped requests and pending unresolved alerts | [Scope contract](contracts.md#poc-incident-scope-selection), [SRE plan](sre_integration_plan.md#3-node-exploration-and-stop-conditions) |
| C-03 | Controller-owned required checks, guarded STOP and explicit unavailable/partial outcomes | [Investigation contracts](contracts.md#incident-and-exploration-extension), [SRE scheduler](sre_integration_plan.md#3-node-exploration-and-stop-conditions) |
| C-04 | Engine fact registry, constrained explanations and final validity checks | [Answer contracts](contracts.md#context-and-answer-response), [Phase 5](phase_05_context_and_llm_answers.md#fact-registry-and-final-publication) |
| C-05 | Durable access registry independent of graph import success | [Access contract](contracts.md#source-access-registry), [Source adapters](source_adapters.md#persistent-source-access-handling) |
| C-06 | One restore operation with durable approval/claim/receipt, reconciliation and measured recovery | [Action protocol](contracts.md#poc-sandbox-execution-protocol), [Sandbox recipe](sre_integration_plan.md#poc-sandbox-recipe) |
| C-07 | One writer, per-projection publication and shared direct/MCP read gates | [Phase 1](phase_01_graph_and_fixtures.md#snapshot-consistency), [Publication policy](graph_publication.md) |

The subsequent design-risk review adds fixed incident windows and independent projection recovery, complete read-set equivalence after model calls, generation-independent clarification with current candidate checks, and asynchronous sandbox execution/status polling. These supersede global-generation-only invalidation and unspecified per-event publication cadence. See [publication acceptance cases](graph_publication.md#required-implementation-evidence) and the [sandbox protocol](contracts.md#poc-sandbox-execution-protocol). Runtime checks remain future implementation work.

## Execution order

To use the project's own implementation work as demo data, follow the [Plane backlog and PR evidence instructions](../demo/plane_project_seed_instructions.md). They provide a reusable eighteen-task catalog, explicit dependencies, idempotent seeding rules and a later real-work PR workflow.

| Order | Design document | Depends on | Completion artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | [Foundation](phase_00_foundation.md) | Shared specifications | Running API/database and deterministic scenarios |
| 1 | [Graph and fixtures](phase_01_graph_and_fixtures.md) | 0 | Durable interrupted-import recovery and scoped query results |
| 2 | [Ingestion and sync](phase_02_ingestion_and_sync.md) | 1 | Normalized snapshots, confirmed links and live Plane/Google Docs smoke evidence |
| 3 | [Traversal and branch decisions](phase_03_traversal_and_branch_decisions.md) | 2 | Correct typed recommendations and trace evidence |
| 4 | [Decision model integration](phase_04_decision_model_integration.md) | 3 | Measured routing choice or documented rules fallback |
| 5 | [Context and LLM answers](phase_05_context_and_llm_answers.md) | 3, 4 | A cited explanation from a real LLM API call |
| 6 | [UI, evaluation and demo](phase_06_ui_evaluation_and_demo.md) | 5 | Reproducible demo and scenario regression report |
| 7 | [Production and actions](phase_07_production_and_actions.md) | 6 | Operational release gates and controlled actions |

Use each completion gate before moving on. A failing semantic adapter can be disabled without preventing graph decisions or the answer LLM. Record provider unavailability as an unevaluated result, not a passing evaluation.

For the incident demo, follow the SRE integration plan's additions to these phases; it is an alternative demo path over the same phases, not an additional workload. The existing development scenarios remain part of the product requirements and regressions when implemented; completing all development and incident features together is not assumed. The shared live Plane/Google Docs gate applies to either demo path.

The recommended hackathon demonstration leads with incident investigation and approved sandbox recovery. The FalkorDB resource plan maps sponsor tools to that workflow and treats document SDK retrieval, native algorithm projections and Canvas as optional additions. Event dates and rules are recorded there.

## Scope boundary

Phase completion is defined by each phase's completion gate, not by elapsed time. Effort is re-estimated after the recovery/persistence and live-adapter compatibility checks rather than committed to hour figures in advance.

The demo covers one organization, one project and one repository. If scope must shrink, cut extra connectors beyond Plane/Google Docs/GitHub, sophisticated visuals, optional checks ingestion and model fine-tuning. Preserve durable recovery, candidate-specific revision effects, the verified branch workflow, review warnings, TLS content, citations, traversal trace and a real retrieval-to-LLM explanation. Live Plane and Google Docs are required completion gates; export fallback is labeled as a partial deliverable. Keep fixtures clearly labeled. A rules-only demo does not establish the value of Jev, Clef or Laya. For the SRE-focused demo, use the alternative scope and cuts in the [SRE integration plan](sre_integration_plan.md).

## Questions settled by default

Python backend; React frontend; fixtures/exports first, then required live Plane/Google Docs/GitHub reads; Markdown and verified manifests supported; durable per-projection recovery, fixed incident batching and scoped answer validation; candidate-specific revision effects; one process/demo tenant/repository; configured stable ref; advisory production actions; model-guided exploration; asynchronous approved sandbox execution with polling; no NER pipeline. Update canonical contracts before changing consumers.

## Design revision gate

Before application implementation, review the import state machine, candidate-effect semantics and source-adapter contract together. Confirm phase scenarios/gates have no marker-only recovery, global delivery-reversion flag or optional-live Plane/Google Docs guidance. Keep the archived original draft unchanged. Documentation validation can verify links, examples and consistency; it cannot claim database recovery, Git scenarios or live providers have passed. Retain the [design revision record](design_revision_record.md) with this distinction.

## Definition of a phase completion

Commit its implementation, update its completion record, run its stated checks, and retain sample output. The record should identify actual versions, fixture/live mode, enabled providers, unresolved limits and the next phase. These documents define future checks; they do not claim that code or service checks have already passed.
